### Code base for the WRI Wave2Web Hackathon 

The repository consists of the following items:

1. Script called weather.py used for collecting and curating the dataset.

2. Jupyter Notebook called ReservoirEDA.ipynb which contains the initial analysis of the given dataset.

3. Jupyter Notebook called dataset_play.ipynb which contains the initial testing of various models for generating the time series dataset and running basic predictive modelling based on the internet search and literature survey.

4. Jupyter Notebook called wave2web.ipynb which contains the code used to train models used in the prototype using XGBoost.

5. Script called dbio.py used for inserting and updating the mysql database on Linux VM on Azure cloud.

6. CSV file named final_dataset_csv.csv which contains the final dataset used for prediction. These are raw values.

7. A PBIX (PowerBi Report) named reservoir.pbix to show the Dashboard which is shown in the demonstration video.
